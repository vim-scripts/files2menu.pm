DESCR     finds files according to predefined file masks in all subdirs starting in parent dir (default).
	creates menu commands for gvim for each file found (creates submenues automatically after 40 menu entries).
	filemasks and other settings may be easily changed within the perl script for your needs.

	Usage: 	files2menu.pm <options>
	options:
	                    	generate file list on stdout (default)
	 -o <filelist>      	generate filelist in file <filelist>
	 -v                 	generate VIM scriptfile
	 -v <scriptfile>    	generate VIM Scriptfile <scriptfile>
	 -f <patternlist>   	use search pattern <patternlist>
		                predefined pattern lists:   CPP, EXE, MAK, GL, DOC, VIM
	 -m                 	create menu entry <menuEntry> for each found file  (blanks allowed in name)
	 -c                 	create submenu after <n> entries
	 -d                 	debug mode
	 -s <startdir>      	start in CWD (default) or parent dir ('..') or <startdir>


I used 'ls' because any other tools had trouble with that genious system of long file names under Windows and Novell.
